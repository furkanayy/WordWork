# SoftwareDevelopmentTermProjectAssignment
The project I developed to help learn English vocabulary in C # programming language and follow these learning impressions for software construction project homework.

# The goal of the project
Developing a project that helps the user to learn words suitable for use by using a database and to follow these learning impressions.

# Content of the Project
<br>-The user is asked the words she wants to learn.
<br>-He user does not have to learn every word, but after seeing the words she wants to learn in the program, only the words she has seen are asked.
<br>-During the learning phase, these words are asked to the user at regular intervals.
<br>-It contains 5 different word types in the database.
<br>-The query intervals of the words are the day after the day, 1 week, 1 month and 6 months later. 
<br>-If he knows the word correctly at the end of the 6th month, it is considered to have learned the word. 
<br>-If the user wants, he can add new words to the database and view the registered words in the database. 
<br>-By selecting the year from the statistics result, he can observe how many he has learned in which month.
